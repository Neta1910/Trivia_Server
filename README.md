**Project explenation:**

This project is an implementation of the Magahimim triva project task of building a trivia game. 
where the server is written in cpp, and the client in c#

**Key changes from original plan:** 

we used react instead of c# for the front end. and in order to make the server work with the web we built a python proxy server to transfer the communication between the cpp serevr and the react front end
